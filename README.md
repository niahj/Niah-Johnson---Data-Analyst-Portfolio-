# Analyzing Bike Sales with MS Excel:
Using Microsoft Excel to analyze company bike sales data, I used VLOOKUP and pivot tables to visualize this data on a dashboard. In this analysis, the goal was to answer questions like:
* Did the average income of in-store customers correlate to buying a bike?
* What age group bought the most bikes?
* What impact did the customer commute have on bike sales? What customer commute distance had the most bike sales?

* Excel Workbook
